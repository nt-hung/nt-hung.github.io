<!-- Range-based navigation is defined for an agent, for example, a scuba-diver or
an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to find its own state (position, and possibly with velocity and acceleration) using
the information measured by the agent itself and the ranges to a known single or multiple
beacons. If an agent like AUV can measure its velocity vector (using
Doppler Velocity Log (DVL)), then only the position of the AUV needs to be determined.
In other situations, velocity and acceleration need to be determined as well. -->

Cooperative simultaneous target localization and pursuit (cooperative SLAP) is a problem defined for one or
multiple autonomous robots/vehicles acting as mobile sensors to find the state of unknown moving target using some sort of information
measured about the target. The state of the target typically includes the target’s position, velocity, and
even possibly acceleration, depending on the model of the target adopted. The information about the target can be ranges, bearings, or both, depending on sensing capability of the robots.

## Contributions

We propose a two approaches to the range-based SLAP problems:
- A centralized approach using MPC and Baysian Cramer Rao Lower Bound.
- A distributed approach using tools from nonlinear control, distributed control, and distributed estimation.
