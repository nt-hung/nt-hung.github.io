<!-- Range-based navigation is defined for an agent, for example, a scuba-diver or
an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to find its own state (position, and possibly with velocity and acceleration) using
the information measured by the agent itself and the ranges to a known single or multiple
beacons. If an agent like AUV can measure its velocity vector (using
Doppler Velocity Log (DVL)), then only the position of the AUV needs to be determined.
In other situations, velocity and acceleration need to be determined as well. -->
