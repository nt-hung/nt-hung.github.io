## Path following control  

- A study on path following control methods for autonomous robotic vehicles, covering a wide variety techniques based on Lyapunov stability theory or optimization based techniques such as Nonlinear Model Predictive Control
- Simulation toolboxes testing path following methods
    - [Matlab](https://github.com/hungrepo/path-following-Matlab)
    - [ROS/Gazebo](https://github.com/dsor-isr/Paper-PathFollowingSurvey) 
- Experience shared with field trials with several types of marine robots
