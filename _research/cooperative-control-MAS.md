Suppose that we have a network of multi nonlinear agent system, where each agent dynamics are described a model, given by 
$$
\bf{dot{x}}_i=A\bfx_i + {\bf f}({\bf x}_i,t) + B {\bf u}_i 
$$
for all $i \in {1,...,N}$.
Furthermore, the communications among the agents are constrained by a network topology that can be modeled by a directed graph.
The consensus/synchronization problem is defined for fiding a distributed control strategy for ${\bf u}_i$ s.t. asymtotically, the trajectories of all agents are synchronized (reach consensus), i.e. ${\bf x}_i(t)={\bf x}_j(t)$ for all $i,j \in {1,...N}$ as $t\to \infinity$. 

## Contribution
In this work we propose a distributed control strategy with an event-triggered communication (ETC) framework that aims at reducing communications among the agents. The framework possess two important properties: i) practical consensus stabilization, that is, the synchronization error that measures the disagreement among agentsâ€™ states converges to a ball centered at the origin, with a radius that can be made arbitrarily small and ii) the minimum of the inter-event times for each agent is strictly positive, hence Zeno behavior is excluded.
