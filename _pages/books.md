This is a list of my favorite books in the areas of control engineering and robotics. They are well-written, presenting the key knowledge in a clear manner that are very useful for us to build our background in the areas.

## Applied mathematics

-  "Introduction to Linear Algebra, by Gilbert Strang", fourth edition, 2009
-  "Convex Optimization, by Lieven Vandenberghe and Stephen P. Boyd, 2004 

## Control and network theory

-  Linear System Theory and Design, by Chi-TSong CHEN, 1984
-  Nonlinear Systems, by Hassan K Khalil, 2002
-  Model Predictive Control: Theory, Computation, and Design, 2nd Edition, by James B. Rawlings, David Q. Mayne, and Moritz M. Diehl, 2020
-  Lectures on Network Systems, by Francisco Bullo, 2018

## Estimation theory

-  Detection, Estimation, and Modulation Theory: Detection, Estimation, and Linear Modulation Theory, by Harry L. Van Trees 1969
