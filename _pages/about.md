Welcome! I am a control and robotics enthusiast with a PhD in electrical and computer engineering, awarded in 2021 by the [Institute For Systems and Robotics (ISR)](https://isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), university of Lisbon. My PhD research* was supervised by [Prof. Antonio Pascoal](https://www.antoniopascoal.com/about-me) at the ISR Lisbon, and partially with [Prof. Tor A. Johansen](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/tor.arne.johansen) at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), focused on control of networked robotic systems. Following my PhD, I spent two years at [Deimos-Space](https://deimos-space.com/), leading the design of control systems for the satellites and launch vehicles developed for clients such as [ClearSpace (Switzerland)](https://clearspace.today/) and [Orbex (UK)](https://orbex.space/). Currently, I work as a technical lead in guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) at the [Autonomous Robotics Research Center](https://www.tii.ae/autonomous-robotics/our-research#control-and-decision-making), the Technology Innovation Institute (TII), Abu-Dhabi.

My research interests include motion planning, navigation, and control for both single and networked autonomous robotic vehicles.
