Welcome! I am a PhD candidate under supervision of [Prof. Antonio Pascoal](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/author/antoniomanueldossantos/) at the [Institute for Systems and Robotics](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), [University of Lisbon](https://www.ulisboa.pt/en). I have joined [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) since 2016 as a research fellow in the Marie Sklodowska Curie Innovative Training Networks of the [MarineUAS](http://www.marineuas.eu/) European research project (2016–2018). My work is at the intersection of control, estimation, optimization, and network science with applications in control and navigation of a single or multiple autonomous vehicles/mobile robots.
