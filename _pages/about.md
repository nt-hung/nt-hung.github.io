Welcome! I am a PhD fellow in the [Institute for Systems and Robotics](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) at [Instituto Superior Técnico
](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), [University of Lisbon](https://www.ulisboa.pt/en). I was a research fellow with the Marie Sklodowska Curie Innovative Training Networks of the [MarineUAS](http://www.marineuas.eu/) project from 2016–2018. My research interests include control, estimation, optimization, and network science with applications in control and navigation of single or multiple cooperative autonomous robots/vehicles. My work is under supervision of Prof. [Antionio Pascoal](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/author/antoniomanueldossantos/).
