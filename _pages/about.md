Welcome! I am a PhD student under supervision of [Prof. Antonio Pascoal](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/author/antoniomanueldossantos/) at the [Institute for Systems and Robotics](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), [University of Lisbon](https://www.ulisboa.pt/en). I was a research fellow with the Marie Sklodowska Curie Innovative Training Networks of the [MarineUAS](http://www.marineuas.eu/) European research project from 2016–2018. My work is at the intersection of control, estimation, optimization, and network science with applications in control and navigation of a single or multiple cooperative mobile robots/autonomous vehicles.
