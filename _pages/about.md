Welcome! I am a control and robotics enthusiast. I obtain a PhD (on July 2021) in electrical and computer engineering from the [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), [University of Lisbon](https://www.ulisboa.pt/en). My PhD work was under supervision of [Prof. Antonio Pascoal](https://www.antoniopascoal.com/about-me), addressing problems involving cooperative control and estimation of multiple robot/autonomous vehicles. My current work is at the intersection of control, estimation, optimization, and network science with the focus on applications in motion planing, guidance, navigation, and control of a single and networked multiple robots/autonomous vehicles.
