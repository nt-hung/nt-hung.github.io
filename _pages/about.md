Welcome! I am a control and robotics enthusiast. I obtain a PhD (on July 2021) in electrical and computer engineering from the [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), [University of Lisbon](https://www.ulisboa.pt/en). My PhD work was supervised by [Prof. Antonio Pascoal](https://www.antoniopascoal.com/about-me), addressing problems in cooperative control and estimation of networked multiple autonomous vehicles*. Right after the PhD, I joined [Elecnor-Deimos](https://elecnor-deimos.com/clearspace/) as a Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) Engineer, working in projects involving the research and development of GNC systems for autonomous robotic vehicles. 

My current research interest is at the intersection of control, estimation, optimization, and network science with the focus on applications in motion planing, guidance, navigation, and control of a single and networked multiple autonomous vehicles/robots.
