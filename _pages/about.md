Welcome! I am a PhD student under supervision of [Prof. Antonio Pascoal](https://www.antoniopascoal.com/about-me) at the [Institute for Systems and Robotics](https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), [University of Lisbon](https://www.ulisboa.pt/en). My PhD work is at the intersection of control, estimation, optimization, and network science with the focus on applications in motion planing, guidance, navigation, and control of a single and networked multiple robots/autonomous vehicles.
