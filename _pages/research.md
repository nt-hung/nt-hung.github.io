My research tackles problems involving the cooperative control and estimation of networked multi-agent systems under communication constraints. Each agent can be a mobile ground robot, an autonomous arial/marine vehicle (AUV), or simply, a sensor node. Applications include formation control of multiple autonomous vehicles, cooperative target localization and pursuit, synchronization of networked multiple robots, etc. The solutions proposed possess the following properties:

- distributed, i.e. agents (robots) only communicate with their neighbors. 
- event-triggered communications, i.e. agents only communicate with their neighbor when found necessary.
