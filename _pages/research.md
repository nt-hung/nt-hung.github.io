My research tackles problems involving the cooperative control and estimation of networked multi agent systems under communication constraints. Each agent can be a mobile ground robot, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), or simply, a sensor node. Applications include formation control of autonomous vehicle, cooperative target localization, synchronization of networked multiple robots, etc. Due to the communication constraints on the topology of the inter-agent communication network, where each agent is only capable of exchanging information with a subset of agents in the network, the problems must be addressed in a distributed manner. In my research, event-triggered communication (ETC) mechanisms are introduced to reduce communications among the agents while theoretically, performance on the cooperative network is still preserved. These ETC mechanisms save network bandwidth and make it more scalable.
