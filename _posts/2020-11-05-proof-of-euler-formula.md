As we know Euler’s fomula is very ubiquitous in mathematics, physics, and engineering. The fomula is as follows:
$e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta)$

In the book “Linear Algebra and Its Applications”, Prof. Gilbert Strang shared an interesting story about the proof of the formula that: One day there was a letter came to MIT from a prisoner in New York, asking if Euler’s fomula was true? It is really astonishing. Three key functions of mathematics come together in such a graceful way.

The proof of the Euler’s fomulas, in fact is quite simple using the Tayler series.
